            <p>The following content is from an interview conducted with a former Eastasian political prisoner who was once captured by Big Sister’s army, Thomas Tseng. Two weeks after being arrested and forced to work, Thomas Tseng was freed by Big Sister when Oceania surrendered to Eastasia and began fighting against Eurasia.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>At the start, I was determined to become a good “comrade’. As a prisoner of war, you certainly did not know what could happen to you. Big Sister said that she would punish us if we didn’t follow her. That itself was quite frightening. So since there was nothing that I could do to help myself except for following her ridiculous rules, I decided to do just that. Unlike what I expected, it was extremely difficult and tiring. Even though I thought that Big Sister’s rules made absolutely no sense, I had to pretend as though it was logical.</p>

                <p>The most important thing that I learned from being under Big Sister’s regime was how easily discipline could be enforced. We live in a world today where discipline is being enforced in an almost hidden way. Before, I never thought about how I was being disciplined. A lot of times, we believe that discipline is enforced because of an external factor or person. Even though that certainly is true because our teachers, parents, and the government set rules for us, but after being under Big Sister’s regime, I found out that one must be willing to be disciplined in order for them to get disciplined. This may sound really strange, but I think that there’s always some reason behind why someone is willing to let themselves get disciplined. Under Big Sister’s regime, I followed Big Sister’s rule as hard as I could because I was afraid of the punishment. Big Sister did not need to do anything except for letting me know that there would be a punishment if I broke her rules. Big Sister did not need to actually have a punishment in order for me to obey her. The idea that there is a punishment and that she is watching me was enough to make me discipline myself. I think that was definitely something that I learned from being under her regime.</p>

                <p>Q3: Was there a turning point in the game? If so, explain what it was?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Yes, there certainly was a turning point in the game. One day, Big Sister suddenly announced to the public that she would implement a monetary fine for those who break certain rules. On top of that, she said that she would not set my Eastasian friends and I free if we continued to break one specific rule. To be honest, I was shocked by her decision to do that. As harsh as Big Sister may be, I did not think that Big Sister would make the punishment which was already quite tough, even tougher. At one point, I thought that my friends and I would never be free. If just one of us breaks the rule, we would have to live under her for an extra day. An extra day may not seem that bad, but if you were there, you would know how terrible it is to have to endure her for another day. So when Big Sister announced that she would make the punishment even harsher, I suddenly realized that she could twist things in her way at any time to make my life even harder. </p>

                <p>One of the reasons why being under Big Sister’s regime was so pressuring is because everyone was under constant surveillance. Unlike here in Eastasia where surveillance is done through cameras, a lot of the surveillance in Oceania is not only done through cameras, but people. When we were first arrested and brought to Oceania, Big Sister selected some of us to become her Spies. Since I knew that there were some secret Spies within our group who are constantly watching us, my awareness of my own actions increased. Before I do anything, I would have to slow down and quickly go over the rules to see if I was breaking any rules. As I’ve mentioned before, most of the time, I was the one who disciplined myself. Before, I did not really think about how surveillance could impact my actions so much. But being under Big Sister’s intense and continuous surveillance made me feel the pressure to comply. I saw how well surveillance could help those in power exert more control. Surveillance is almost like a hidden force that pushes one down.</p>

                <p>Q5: Did you want to rebel at any point? Why?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Throughout the time being under Big Sister, I never really thought about rebelling. Even though my freedom was limited and at certain times I felt quite frustrated, I did not actually think about the possibility of rebelling. The reason why I never really wanted to rebel was because I knew how futile it was. No matter how hard I tried, my attempt to rebel would probably just end up causing more trouble for me. I think that I did pretty well to not let the idea of a rebellion overtake me.</p>

                <p>The rule that I found the most difficult to follow was the one that forbids people from calling others by their first name.  Names are just so innate to human beings. When people are stripped of their names, they almost become machine-like. So since whenever I see a person, a name is automatically attached to that person, holding myself back from calling them by their first name was extremely arduous.</p>

                <p>Q7: How did the experience of being under Big Sister affect you?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>I think that being under Big Sister’s tyrannical rule helped me learn more about how our society works. There are so many small details in our lives that we tend to not notice about. But through the experience of being under Big Sister’s rule, I started to reflect on the way discipline is enforced and the hidden techniques of how power is being exerted. Also, after having to force myself to act and think in a certain way, I began to wonder whether or not what I believe to be true is actually true. I think that the experience of being under Big Sister’s rule made my understanding of our society and the world change.</p>
